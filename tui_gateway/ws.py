"""WebSocket transport for the tui_gateway JSON-RPC server.

Reuses :func:`tui_gateway.server.dispatch` verbatim so every RPC method, every
slash command, every approval/clarify/sudo flow, and every agent event flows
through the same handlers whether the client is Ink over stdio or an iOS /
web client over WebSocket.

Wire protocol
-------------
Identical to stdio: newline-delimited JSON-RPC in both directions. The server
emits a ``gateway.ready`` event immediately after connection accept, then
echoes responses/events for inbound requests. No framing differences.

Mounting

    ``write`` is safe to call from any thread *other than* the event loop
    thread that owns the socket. Pool workers (the only real caller) run in
    their own threads, so marshalling onto the loop via
    :func:`asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe` + ``future.result()`` is correct
    and deadlock-free there.

    When called from the loop thread itself (e.g. by ``handle_ws`` for an
    inline response) the same call would deadlock: we'd schedule work onto
    the loop we're currently blocking. We detect that case and fire-and-
    forget instead. Callers that need to know when the bytes are on the wire
    should use :meth:`write_async` from the loop thread.
