"""Windows subprocess compatibility helpers.

Hermes is developed on Linux / macOS and tested natively on Windows too.
Several common subprocess patterns break silently-or-loudly on Windows:

* ``["npm", "install", ...]`` — on Windows ``npm`` is ``npm.cmd``, a batch
  shim.  ``subprocess.Popen(["npm", ...])`` fails with WinError 193
  ("not a valid Win32 application") because CreateProcessW can't run a
  ``.cmd`` file without ``shell=True`` or PATHEXT resolution.

* ``start_new_session=True`` — on POSIX, this maps to ``os.setsid()`` and
  actually detaches the child.  On Windows it's silently ignored; the
  Windows equivalent is ``CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP | DETACHED_PROCESS``
  creationflags, which Python only applies when you pass them explicitly.

* Console-window flashes — every ``subprocess.Popen`` of a ``.exe`` on
  Windows spawns a cmd window briefly unless ``CREATE_NO_WINDOW`` is
  passed.  Cosmetic but jarring for background daemons.

This module centralizes the platform-branching logic so the rest of the
codebase doesn't sprinkle ``if sys.platform == "win32":`` everywhere.

**All helpers are no-ops on non-Windows** — calling them in Linux/macOS
code paths is safe by design.  That's the "do no damage on POSIX"
guarantee.

def resolve_node_command(name: str, argv: Sequence[str]) -> list[str]:
    """Resolve a Node-ecosystem command name to an absolute-path argv.

    On Windows, commands like ``npm``, ``npx``, ``yarn``, ``pnpm``,
    ``playwright``, ``prettier`` ship as ``.cmd`` files (batch shims).
    ``subprocess.Popen(["npm", "install"])`` fails with WinError 193
    because CreateProcessW doesn't execute batch files directly.

    ``shutil.which(name)`` *does* resolve ``.cmd`` via PATHEXT and returns
    the fully-qualified path — which CreateProcessW accepts because the
    extension tells Windows to route through ``cmd.exe /c``.

    On POSIX ``shutil.which`` also returns a fully-qualified path when
    found.  That's a small change from bare-name resolution (the OS does
    its own PATH search) but functionally identical and has the side
    benefit of making the argv reproducible in logs.

    Behavior when the command is not on PATH:
    - On Windows: return the bare name — caller can still try with
      ``shell=True`` as a last resort, OR the subsequent Popen will
      raise FileNotFoundError with a readable error we want to surface.
    - On POSIX: same.  Bare ``npm`` on a Linux box without npm installed
      fails the same way it did before this function existed.

    Args:
        name: The command name to resolve (``npm``, ``npx``, ``node`` …).
        argv: The remaining arguments.  Must NOT include ``name`` itself —
            this function builds the full argv list.

    Returns:
        A list suitable for passing to subprocess.Popen/run/call.

    which maps to ``os.setsid()`` in the child.

    Rationale:
    - ``CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP`` — child has its own process group so
      Ctrl+C in the parent console doesn't propagate.
    - ``DETACHED_PROCESS`` — child has no console at all.  Necessary for
      background daemons (gateway watchers, update respawners) because
      without it, closing the console kills the child.
    - ``CREATE_NO_WINDOW`` — suppress the brief cmd flash that would
      otherwise appear when launching a console app.  Redundant with
      DETACHED_PROCESS but explicit for clarity.

    flash but also want to collect stdout/exit code synchronously.

    The key difference from :func:`windows_detach_flags`: NO
    ``DETACHED_PROCESS`` — the child still inherits stdio handles so
    ``capture_output=True`` works.  ``DETACHED_PROCESS`` would sever
    stdio and break stdout capture.
