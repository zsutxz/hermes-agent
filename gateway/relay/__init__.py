"""Relay/connector support package for the Hermes gateway.

EXPERIMENTAL. This package implements the gateway side of the "Gateway Gateway"
relay design: a generic ``RelayAdapter`` plus the wire-serializable
``CapabilityDescriptor`` the connector hands it at handshake time, and the
production ``WebSocketRelayTransport`` that dials the connector. The public API
(module names, descriptor field set, transport protocol) MAY CHANGE without a
deprecation cycle until at least two real Class-1 platforms (Discord + Telegram)
have shaken out the schema.

See ``docs/relay-connector-contract.md`` for the formal cross-repo interface.

Activation is driven by configuration, not a separate feature flag: the relay
platform is registered when a connector relay URL is configured
(``GATEWAY_RELAY_URL`` env or ``gateway.relay_url`` in config.yaml). Deployments
that don't set it are unaffected — exactly the same shape as ``gateway.proxy_url``.

def self_provision_relay() -> bool:
    """Boot-time relay self-provision: mint relay creds in-process, no human, no disk.

    Fires when relay is configured (``relay_url()`` set) and NO per-gateway secret
    is already present, AND the agent can resolve its own Nous access token. In
    that case the runtime resolves the agent's own Nous access token (the same
    ``resolve_nous_access_token()`` the enroll CLI / dashboard register use),
    POSTs ``/relay/provision`` asserting its own endpoint + route keys, and sets
    ``GATEWAY_RELAY_ID`` / ``GATEWAY_RELAY_SECRET`` / ``GATEWAY_RELAY_DELIVERY_KEY``
    into ``os.environ`` so the subsequent ``register_relay_adapter()`` picks them
    up. The creds live ONLY in process memory — never written to ``~/.hermes/.env``.

    The trigger is deliberately NOT ``is_managed()``: that means
    "package-manager/NixOS-managed" and is False on a NAS-hosted Fly agent (which
    sets neither ``HERMES_MANAGED`` nor a ``.managed`` marker), so gating on it
    blocked the exact hosted case this is for. The real signal is "you pointed me
    at a connector and didn't pin a secret" — which is both NAS-independent and
    self-guarding:

      - A NAS-hosted agent: has ``GATEWAY_RELAY_URL``, no pinned secret, and a
        bootstrapped NAS token -> self-provisions.
      - A self-hosted operator who ran ``hermes gateway enroll``: has a PINNED
        ``GATEWAY_RELAY_SECRET`` -> skipped (the secret-present guard below).
      - A self-hosted box with a relay URL but no NAS identity:
        ``resolve_nous_access_token()`` fails -> graceful no-op.

    Stateless: process-env creds don't survive a restart, so a hosted container
    re-provisions every boot; the connector's rotation window covers a still-
    connected prior instance. An explicitly-pinned ``GATEWAY_RELAY_SECRET`` (env
    or config) is RESPECTED — self-provision skips so an operator pin isn't
    stomped.

    Returns True if it provisioned, False otherwise. NEVER raises: a provision
    failure logs and returns False so the gateway still boots (and
    ``register_relay_adapter`` will simply dial unauthenticated / be rejected,
    rather than the whole gateway crashing).
