# ---------- Layer-cached Python dependency install ----------
# Copy only pyproject.toml + uv.lock so the Python dep resolve + wheel
# download + native-extension compile layer is cached unless those inputs
# change.  Before this split the Python install sat after `COPY . .`, so
# every source-only commit re-did ~4-5 min of dep work on cold builds.
#
# README.md is referenced by pyproject.toml's `readme =` field, but it's
# excluded from the build context by .dockerignore's `*.md`.  uv's build
# frontend stats the readme path during dep resolution, so we `touch` an
# empty placeholder — the real README is restored by `COPY . .` below.
#
# `uv sync --frozen --no-install-project --extra all` installs only the
# deps reachable through the composite `[all]` extra (handpicked set
# intended for the production image).  We do NOT use `--all-extras`:
# that would pull in `[rl]` (atroposlib + tinker + torch + wandb from
# git), `[yc-bench]` (another git dep), and `[termux-all]` (Android
# redundancy), none of which belong in the published container.

# hermes_cli/main.py succeeds (see #18800). /opt/hermes/web is build-time
# only (HERMES_WEB_DIST points at hermes_cli/web_dist) and is intentionally
