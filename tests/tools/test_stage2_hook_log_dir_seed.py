"""Contract test: the s6-overlay stage2 hook seeds $HERMES_HOME/logs/gateways
as the hermes user.

Regression guard for #45258: the per-profile gateway log service
(`gateway-<profile>/log/run`) creates `logs/gateways/` via `mkdir -p` but only
chowns the leaf `logs/gateways/<profile>`. If the first log service to boot
runs in root context, the `gateways/` parent is created root-owned and stays
that way; every profile registered later runs its log service as the dropped
hermes user and s6-log crash-loops on `mkdir: Permission denied`.

Seeding `logs/gateways` in stage2 (cont-init runs before any service starts)
guarantees the parent already exists hermes-owned by the time the first
log/run executes its `mkdir -p`.
