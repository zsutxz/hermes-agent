# Built-in Tools Reference

This page documents Hermes' built-in tools, grouped by toolset. Availability varies by platform, credentials, and enabled toolsets.

**Quick counts (current registry):** ~70 tools — 10 browser tools (core) + 2 CDP-gated browser tools, 4 file tools, 10 RL tools, 4 Home Assistant tools, 2 terminal tools, 2 web tools, 5 Feishu tools, 7 Spotify tools (registered by the bundled `spotify` plugin), 5 Yuanbao tools, 7 kanban tools (registered when the kanban dispatcher spawns the agent), 2 Discord tools, and a handful of standalone tools (`memory`, `clarify`, `delegate_task`, `execute_code`, `cronjob`, `session_search`, `skill_view`/`skill_manage`/`skills_list`, `text_to_speech`, `image_generate`, `vision_analyze`, `video_analyze`, `mixture_of_agents`, `send_message`, `todo`, `computer_use`, `process`).

:::tip MCP Tools
In addition to built-in tools, Hermes can load tools dynamically from MCP servers. MCP tools appear with the prefix `mcp_<server>_` (e.g., `mcp_github_create_issue` for the `github` MCP server). See [MCP Integration](/docs/user-guide/features/mcp) for configuration.

## `browser` toolset

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `browser_back` | Navigate back to the previous page in browser history. Requires browser_navigate to be called first. | — |

| `browser_navigate` | Navigate to a URL in the browser. Initializes the session and loads the page. Must be called before other browser tools. For simple information retrieval, prefer web_search or web_extract (faster, cheaper). Use browser tools when you need… | — |
| `browser_press` | Press a keyboard key. Useful for submitting forms (Enter), navigating (Tab), or keyboard shortcuts. Requires browser_navigate to be called first. | — |

## `browser` toolset (CDP-gated tools)

These two tools live in the `browser` toolset but only register when a Chrome DevTools Protocol endpoint is reachable at session start — via `/browser connect`, `browser.cdp_url` config, a Browserbase session, or Camofox.

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `browser_cdp` | Send a raw Chrome DevTools Protocol command. Escape hatch for browser operations not covered by the higher-level `browser_*` tools. See https://chromedevtools.github.io/devtools-protocol/ | CDP endpoint |
| `browser_dialog` | Respond to a native JavaScript dialog (alert / confirm / prompt / beforeunload). Call `browser_snapshot` first — pending dialogs appear in its `pending_dialogs` field. Then call `browser_dialog(action='accept'\|'dismiss')`. | CDP endpoint |

## `clarify` toolset

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `clarify` | Ask the user a question when you need clarification, feedback, or a decision before proceeding. Supports two modes: 1. **Multiple choice** — provide up to 4 choices. The user picks one or types their own answer via a 5th 'Other' option. 2.… | — |

## `delegation` toolset

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| `delegate_task` | Spawn one or more subagents to work on tasks in isolated contexts. Each subagent gets its own conversation, terminal session, and toolset. Only the final summary is returned -- intermediate tool results never enter your context window. TWO… | — |

## `file` toolset

| Tool | Description | Requires environment |

:::note
**Honcho tools** (`honcho_profile`, `honcho_search`, `honcho_context`, `honcho_reasoning`, `honcho_conclude`) are no longer built-in.
