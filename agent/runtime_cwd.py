"""Single source of truth for the agent working directory.

`TERMINAL_CWD` is the runtime carrier for the configured working directory
(design #19214/#19242: `terminal.cwd` is bridged once to `TERMINAL_CWD` at
gateway/cron startup). The local-CLI backend deliberately leaves it unset and
relies on the launch dir. Reading it in one place keeps the system prompt, the
tool surfaces, and context-file discovery agreeing on where the agent lives.

The #29531 per-session extension point is this function: a future PR adds a
contextvar arm inside `resolve_agent_cwd` and `.set()`s it at the
`set_session_vars` seam — by design, not a reopening hazard.
